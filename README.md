# About Project
This project was part of our course subject Data Structures and Algorithm. In this project I have tried to make use of Linked list data structures to make a snake and ladder game. This project was made using HTML, CSS and Java script. Advanced java script concepts such as promises, async/await, as well as advanced css concepts to make our own custom dice were used in this project.
